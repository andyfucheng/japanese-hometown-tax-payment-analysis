# japanese-hometown-tax-payment-analysis-2020
This analysis aims to analyze the impact of Japan's hometown tax system on regional revitalization. The attached dataset contains hometown tax payments and prefecture-level GDP data for 47 prefectures from 2008 to 2017. Furthermore, in this analysis, panel analysis is applied to analyze two-dimensional data that collected over time and over the same local governments.

## Summary of Data
This analysis project is based on Japanese hometown tax payment and total production data of 47 prefectures collected from ministry of internal affairs and communications. This fiscal policy is implemented to reduce the fiscal gap between metropolitan cities and rural areas which results from low birth rate and increase of elder population. Our ultimate goal is to analyze the relationship between hometown tax payment and  local change of production, attempting to figure out if this policy has achieved its intention.

Beside the prefecture-level of production, here includes labor force, inflation, production in the subfields like education, health and social welfare as independent variables.
